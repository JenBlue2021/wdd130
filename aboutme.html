            Idaho is a quiet state, that is covered in miles and miles of fields. If you ever get a chance
            to fly over this great state it looks like a patch work quilt. Truly beautiful. It can 
            get very cold especially in Rexburg, which is the city I am living in, but I dont mind that too much.
